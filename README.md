# sqlalchemy-challenge

Usage:
1. pandas module in Python
2. SQLAlchemy module in Python
3. Flask using Visual Studio Code - app.py

Overview
I am taking a trip to Hawaii and have decided to do some analysis based on some climate data found in the provided SQLite database. 

The following analyses were done:

- Using SQLAlchemy to reflect existing databases to classes in Python
- Using queries to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data and plotting them over time using a pandas DataFrame
- Designing queries to obtain the total number of stations, the most active stations, and the last 12 months of temperature observation data (histogram)
- Creating a Flask API app to create routes that retrieve JSON data such as 
	# precipitation values by date
	# stations 
	# temperature observations from the last year
	# min, max, and average temperatures within a specified date range.
